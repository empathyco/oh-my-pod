We're trying to make it easier for the users to manage the data they want to store in their POD, because the first step to gain users, is to make their life easier.</0><1><0>Improve security and privacy:</0> With the actual way to manage the POD, there are some critical security flaws, for example, granting access to a user so he can deny you access to your own POD, this should not be allowed.</1><1>Build the starting point: a prototype of a search engine based on the SOLID platfrom/principles.</1></0>",
